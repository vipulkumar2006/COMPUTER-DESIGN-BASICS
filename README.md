This project is a simple implementation of a basic arithmetic expression compiler, developed in C++. It focuses on the foundational concepts of Compiler Design, specifically the front-end phases including lexical analysis, syntax analysis (parsing), and semantic evaluation. The goal of this project is to build an evaluator that can read, parse, and compute the result of arithmetic expressions like 2 + 3 * (4 - 1), while maintaining the correct order of operations and handling user input gracefully.

The compiler supports standard arithmetic operators such as addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/), along with parentheses () to group expressions. It uses a recursive descent parser to interpret the expressions based on a simple grammar that enforces operator precedence and associativity rules. This approach mimics how real compilers parse code in programming languages, making this a great starting point for anyone learning compiler design.

The grammar used in the parser is structured as follows: an Expression consists of one or more Terms joined by + or -; each Term consists of Factors joined by * or /; and each Factor is either a number or a parenthesized Expression. This allows the parser to correctly evaluate expressions such as 2 + 3 * 4 as 14, not 20, because multiplication has higher precedence than addition.

The implementation also includes basic error handling. For example, if a user tries to divide by zero, the program will throw a runtime error and display an appropriate message. Similarly, if the input is invalid, such as using illegal characters or leaving parentheses unmatched, the parser will detect it and notify the user. This demonstrates how semantic checks are integrated into the evaluation process.

To run the program, simply compile the C++ file using a standard compiler like g++, and execute the output file. Users can enter expressions one at a time, and type exit to quit the program. The user interface is kept simple and command-line based, making it easy to test multiple inputs interactively.

This project is especially useful for students and beginners who are studying compiler design or want to understand how parsing and expression evaluation work behind the scenes. It is structured in a way that encourages further development. For instance, it can be extended to support variables (e.g., x = 5 + 3), custom functions, abstract syntax trees (AST), or even code generation for simple virtual machines.

In summary, this arithmetic expression compiler showcases the core principles of compiler design in a clean and understandable manner. By breaking down expressions into components and using recursive parsing techniques, the program demonstrates how complex-looking input can be processed, validated, and evaluated. It offers a hands-on introduction to how compilers function and provides a solid foundation for building more advanced language tools in the future.
